# Global-superstore-analysis-dashboard
Hello all,

This analysis provides a detailed report on sales transactions across branches worldwide. It includes various visualizations to help stakeholders analyze and understand key aspects of the business.
Here I have analysed a dataset of Global superstore and created visuals based in some questions related to it. 
I have given a dataset of Global superstore which consists of three tables Orders, People, Returns. The fact table is the order table which consists of all the informations related to the shipments and transactions. The People and Returns table are the fact table. 
Data cleaning- First of all, I have done data cleaning which is to remove the null rows and columns. After that I have created relationships among the three tables.
Based on the questions asked, I have created visuals using pie , stacked column chart, slicer, table, stacked bar chart etc. 
First Segmentation is done based on country, region and market. So a slicer visual is used so that we can easily access each country,region or market. 
Sales by Region (Map):Used the map visual to visually represent sales across different regions.
Sales by City (Stacked Column Chart): Analysed sales trends in various cities using the stacked column chart.
Sales by State (Map): Visualised sales distribution across different states using the map.
Sales by Market (Stacked Bar Chart): Analysed sales performance by market through the stacked bar chart.
To calculate the shipping percentage based on ship mode, a DAX formula is used and to visualise the same used a stacked column chart.
The tables corresponding to the visualisations were created where we can easily access the top most and lowermost countries, cities , region  or market  based on total sales. 
In addition to these,  some basic visualisations are also done like displaying the total profit, total sales, total shipping cost using card visual , a pie chart showing sum of sales by product name, a line ana stacked column  chart showing  sum of sales and count of product ID  by year, slicer to get the data based on order date . 
Hope this interpretations and visuals help you to retrieve a clear cut idea about how Power BI is used to analyse the transactions for a stakeholder. 
Thank you. 
Please see the data set and an explanation video on visuals!!!
